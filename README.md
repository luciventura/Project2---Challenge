# Project2---Challenge
This project is from 100DaysOfSwift. It's a game that shows a name of a country and the player has to tap the correct flag. There were 3 challenges that I had to make myself: create a button that shows the score; create a final score that appears when you play 10 times; and show the correct flag when the player hits the wrong one.
